# JavaScript_Password

## Description


I want to create a password to protect sensitive information that I have acccess to as an employee.
The password should be strong with a mix of different characters and a min lenght of 8 characters and a max of 128.
I built this project to increase the security where the data is stored and prevent any hackers from stealing information.
It solved the problem of choosing a password that meets the criteria for a password that is hard to guess.

## Usage

STEP 1

On the home screen, click on the red button to generate a password.
A pop up willdow will appear and the user will have to enter how many characters they want their password to have

STEP 2

 If user picks a number less than 8 and higher than 128, a pop-up window will prompt the user to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

STEP 3

 Once the user enters the correct amount, a pop up window will prompt the user to chose what kind of  character they wish to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters)

![Do you want to include lowercase?](./img/3.png) 
![Do you want to include uppercase?](./img/4.png) 
![Do you want to include numbers?](./img/5.png) 
![Do you want to include special characters?](./img/6.png) 

When the user enters their input, it will be validated. When at least one character type is selected and all prompts are answered, then a password that matches the selected criteria will be generated and displayed in an alert.

In the case that the user provides input that does not correspond to what the prompt is asking, then a text in a dialog box that pops up on the screen will appear requesting the user for the proper input (e.g. User clicks CANCEL to all the options to generate the password
